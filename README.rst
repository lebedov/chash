Content-Based Hash
==================

Package Description
-------------------
This package provides a hash function for computing the hash of the contents of 
complex data structures. This can be useful for memoization of functions that
process complex data structures (assuming that the produced data structures are
not subsequently modified).

Quick Start
-----------
Make sure you have `pip <http://pip.pypa.io>`_ installed; once you do, install
the package as follows::

  pip install chash

Development
